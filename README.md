# CANOpen-PushButton

CANOpen switch button extension for GIRA 2003100 2 3 switch sensor with parallel 24 V interface. The extension supports the usage of the six buttons, the control of the six LEDs + background light and additional temperature measurement.

The firmware of the switch button is based on the CANopenNode project (https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenNode).

The CAN network consisting of one or multiple CANOpen-PushButtons can be connected to a TwinCAT-based control system e.g. by using the Beckhoff EL6751 CANOpen Master terminal. TwinCAT supports the scan of CANopen networks. Therefore, the switch buttons don't have to be added manually to the TwinCAT configuration. 

For more help or assembly kits of the hardware please feel free to contact me. Unfortunately, I can not offer complete devices, because legal regulations prevent this.
